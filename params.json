{"name":"xmlwrapp","tagline":"Lightweight C++ XML parsing library","body":"0. Introduction\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nxmlwrapp is a modern style C++ library for working with XML data, built atop\r\nthe venerable libxml2 C library.\r\n\r\nAdditional resources, bug reports, latest sources etc. can be found on the\r\nproject page at https://github.com/vslavik/xmlwrapp\r\n\r\nIf you need help or want to discuss xmlwrapp, feel free to join the discussion\r\ngroup hosted at http://groups.google.com/group/xmlwrapp or email directly to\r\nxmlwrapp@googlegroups.com.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Requirements\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nIn order to build xmlwrapp, you need libxml2 version 2.4.28 or newer. When\r\nbuilding with XSLT support, libxslt 1.1.6 or newer is required. Both libraries\r\nare available from http://xmlsoft.org.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Building on Unix\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nOn Unix, the usual Autotools-based build system is used. Building xmlwrapp is\r\nusually as simple as running the following three commands:\r\n\r\n  ./configure\r\n  make\r\n  make install\r\n\r\nSee the output of `./configure --help` for additional settings and options.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Building on Windows\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nAt this time, only building with Visual C++ compiler is supported. The required\r\nproject files are located in platform/Win32 directory. You will need libxml\r\nand libxslt libraries built for Windows, e.g. the binaries from\r\nhttp://www.zlatkovic.com/libxml.en.html.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Using xmlwrapp\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nOn Unix, you should use pkg-config to get compiler flags for xmlwrapp or\r\nxsltwrapp libraries:\r\n\r\n   c++ -c `pkg-config --cflags xmlwrapp` ...\r\n   c++ -o ... `pkg-config --libs xmlwrapp`\r\n\r\nOn Windows, you need to link against xmlwrapp libraries and add the include/\r\ndirectory to compiler's headers search path.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
